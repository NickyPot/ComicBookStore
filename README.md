I made this application for my second year coursework for the module Application design in the first semester.

# What this project taught me

This project taught me how to develop a project with a design first approach. I learned to create UML diagrams and entity relationship diagrams. Using these diagrams I designed the SQL database and used it to host the data used by the windows forms application.

 I also learned to use prepared statements in C# in order to perform CRUD methods in the database in a secure manner.
